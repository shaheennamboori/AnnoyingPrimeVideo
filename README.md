<h1>AnnoyingPrimeVideo Chrome Extension</h1>
<h2>Overview:</h2>
This extension enhances your Prime Video viewing experience by removing intrusive elements like the X-Ray quick view and minimizing the size of the play/pause/forward button overlay. It also hides the title overlay since you already know what you're watching!
